title: Setting up website using Quarto
editor: { render-on-save: true }

In this session, you will see how I developed the website you are currently viewing.

I will be using VSCode to work with Quarto and to develop the website.

First, I want to add the Quarto extension in VSCode.

Next, I will create a project.

After clicking on Quarto: Create Project, select "Website Project."

This provides a skeleton for the website.

After this, you can render the website to see if it is working. I used the command line for this. I navigated to the folder where my project is located and ran quarto preview.

I can also render it to create the HTML for the website.

Woohoo! It looks quite neat.

Now, I will work on the website structure. I’m not completely clear on the structure I want, but I’m thinking of creating a couple of sections and .qmd files within each section.

The website structure is something you want work in `_quarto.yml`.
