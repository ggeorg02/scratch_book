title: Setting up website using Quarto
editor: { render-on-save: true }
---

In this session, you will see how I developed the website you are currently viewing.

I will be using VSCode to work with Quarto and to develop the website.

First, I want to add the Quarto extension in VSCode.

Next, I will create a project.

After clicking on Quarto: Create Project, select "Website Project."

This provides a skeleton for the website.

After this, you can render the website to see if it is working. I used the command line for this. I navigated to the folder where my project is located and ran quarto preview.

I can also render it to create the HTML for the website. `quarto render`.

If you get an error like below, then make sure you install reticulate correctly. Or point to the R that you installed. Here is what i did in my case:

>export QUARTO_R=/Users/ggeorg02/opt/miniconda3/envs/rvscodeR/bin/R

Here is some more info: [https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6162](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6162)
```
Error in `loadNamespace()`:
! there is no package called 'reticulate'
Backtrace:

 17. base (local) doWithOneRestart(return(expr), restart)
Warning message:
The 'python' engine in knitr requires the reticulate package. If you do not want to use the reticulate package, set the chunk option python.reticulate = FALSE.

Woohoo! It looks quite neat.

Now it is time to publish. 


Trigger.... `quarto publish`. 

::: {.callout-caution}
If you get into any issue like below:

```
error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```
Then it is possible that a large push to the `gh-pages` branch could exceed the default buffer size. If this is the case, increase the buffer size and try again.

```
git config --global http.postBuffer 157286400
```

Now, I will work on the website structure. I’m not completely clear on the structure I want, but I’m thinking of creating a couple of sections and .qmd files within each section.

The website structure is something you want work in `_quarto.yml`.

Here are few resources that I found helpful:

- [Understanding book structure in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html)
- [Various navigations in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html)
- [How to publish a Quarto website to GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)
- [Call out block in Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) - this is similar to the admonition block in Jupyter book.
