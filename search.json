I used the command line for this. I navigated to the folder where my project is located and ran quarto preview.\n\nI can also render it to create the HTML for the website.\n\nWoohoo! It looks quite neat.\n\nNow it is time to publish.\nTrigger…. quarto publish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDanger\n\n\n\nIf you get into any issue like below:\nerror: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400\nsend-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet\nfatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly\nThen it is possible that a large push to the gh-pages branch could exceed the default buffer size. If this is the case, increase the buffer size and try again.\ngit config --global http.postBuffer 157286400\n\n\nNow, I will work on the website structure. I’m not completely clear on the structure I want, but I’m thinking of creating a couple of sections and .qmd files within each section.\nThe website structure is something you want work in _quarto.yml.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere are few resources that I found helpful:\n\nUnderstanding book structure in Quarto\nVarious navigations in Quarto\nHow to publish a Quarto website to GitHub Pages\nCall out block in Quarto - this is similar to the admonition block in Jupyter book."
