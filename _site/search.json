I used the command line for this. I navigated to the folder where my project is located and ran quarto preview.\n\nI can also render it to create the HTML for the website.\n\nWoohoo! It looks quite neat.\n\nNow, I will work on the website structure. I’m not completely clear on the structure I want, but I’m thinking of creating a couple of sections and .qmd files within each section.\nThe website structure is something you want work in _quarto.yml."
